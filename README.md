Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 2

I have completed Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Info Tech. The task involved conducting data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset obtained from Kaggle.

The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their demographics and survival status. This dataset is widely used for educational purposes and provides an opportunity to explore various data analysis techniques.

The main objective of this task was to clean the data and perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the Titanic dataset. This involved handling missing values and exploring relationships between variables to identify patterns and trends in the data.

The analysis highlights include:
1. Data cleaning to handle missing values and duplicates.
2. Exploration of relationships between variables such as gender, passenger class, age, fare, and survival rate.
3. Identification of patterns and trends in the data, including the higher survival rate among females, the impact of passenger class on survival, and the relationship between age and survival.

In conclusion, the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights into the factors influencing survival rates during the Titanic disaster. This analysis contributes to a better understanding of historical events and showcases the application of data science techniques in deriving meaningful insights from data.
